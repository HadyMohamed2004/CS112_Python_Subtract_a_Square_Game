Subtract a Square Game using Python
This is a two-player mathematical game of strategy.
It is played by two people with a pile of coins (or other tokens) between them.
The players take turns removing coins from the pile, always removing a non-zero square number of coins (1, 4, 9, 16, ...).

**The player who removes the last coin wins.**
